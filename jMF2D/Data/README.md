### Here, we provide the simulated data1 and human breast cancer datasets. Their raw data can be obtained from the following link: 

#### 1. simulated data1:  

#### scRNA-seq: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE115469 

#### The scRNA-seq for simulating spatial transcriptomics: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE124395  

#### 2. human breast cancer 

#### scRNA-seq: https://singlecell.broadinstitute.org/single_cell/study/SCP1039/a-single-cell-and-spatially-resolved-atlas-of-human-breast-cancers

#### spatial transcriptomics: https://zenodo.org/records/4739739



### We have processed these data into CSV format and uploaded them to Google Cloud: [datasets](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tZdHL0QrlbxBE9h9FHCC4qafn2NFJVUX). You can download the data and refer to the tutorials to run jMF2D.
